# Node School.io Solutions
## By: Nick Kasten

<p>The exercises on http://www.nodeschool.io are really well done. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good entry point into Node.js</p>

<p>Take a look at my solutions! I have tried to stick to solving them in a 'Node' style, using asynchronous functions when available, etc.</p>

<p>Later, I'd love to go back and try solving these with ES6. Fun!</p>
